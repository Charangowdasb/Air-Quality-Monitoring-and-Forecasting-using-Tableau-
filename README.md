# Air-Quality-Monitoring-and-Forecasting-using-Tableau-
Air pollution is a growing concern in many parts of the world, especially in fast-developing 
cities. Pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO₂, SO₂, and O₃ are dangerous to human health 
and the environment. Understanding when and where pollution is high can help people and 
governments take the right actions to improve air quality.  
This report uses real air quality data to study pollution levels over time. With the help of  
Tableau, different charts and dashboards were created to show patterns and trends in the data. 
The goal is to find out which pollutants are most common, how air quality changes with time, 
and what factors like temperature and humidity may affect pollution.  
By visualizing and analyzing the data, this report gives useful insights into how bad the air 
quality is and what can be done to improve it. The findings can help raise public awareness 
and support better decisions for a cleaner and healthier environment.  
INTRODUCTION  
Air pollution is one of the most serious problems facing the world today. As cities grow and 
traffic increases, the air becomes filled with harmful gases and particles. These include 
pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂), Sulfur 
Dioxide (SO₂), and Ozone (O₃). Breathing in polluted air can cause health problems like 
coughing, breathing issues, heart disease, and even cancer. It can also harm animals, plants, 
and the climate.  
In this report, we have used air quality data collected from various places to find out how 
pollution levels change over time. We analysed the data using charts and dashboards created 
in Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool. The report shows which pollutants are most 
common, when air quality is worst, and how different weather conditions like temperature 
and humidity affect pollution.  
This analysis helps us understand the main causes of poor air quality. It can also support the 
government and public in taking steps to reduce pollution, such as using cleaner energy, 
planting more trees, or managing traffic better.
